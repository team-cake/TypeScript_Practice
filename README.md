## Statement of Purpose

TypeScript. Heard so much about it and previously I had only touched the surface of it, so I decided to give it a go and went in deep. I went on Udemy and had a look at Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's TypeScript course. I was already following his YouTube channel, so I knew his style already. Super stoked I took on this course. Learning so much from it!
